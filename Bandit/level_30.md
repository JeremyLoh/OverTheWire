# [git-tag](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-tag)

Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

Add a tag reference in refs/tags/, unless -d/-l/-v is given to delete, list or verify tags.

Tags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1). A tag is like a branch that doesnâ€™t change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.

# [git-show](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-show)

`git-show` is a command line utility that is used to view expanded details on Git objects such as blobs, trees, tags, and commits. `git-show` has specific behavior per object type.

Tags show the tag message and other objects included in the tag. Trees show the names and content of objects in a tree. Blobs show the direct content of the blob. Commits show a commit log message and a diff output of the changes in the commit.
