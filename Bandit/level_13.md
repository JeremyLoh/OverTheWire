# Bandit Level 13 -> Level 14

The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by user `bandit14`. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.

Note: `localhost` is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

# ssh command (OpenSSH remote login client)

`-i` option: (identity file), Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.
The default is `~/.ssh/identity` for protocol version 1, and `~/.ssh/id_dsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` for protocol version 2.
